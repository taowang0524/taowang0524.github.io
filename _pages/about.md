Welcome to my personal homepage! I am currently working as an associate professor in School of Mathematics and Statistics of Guangdong University of Techonology. My focus is on numerical methods for the Kohnâ€“Sham equation and complex Langevin methods in quantum chromodynamics.

In the area of the Kohn-Sham equation, I am working on several aspects, including the design adaptive methods and high order methods for discretization, the development of orthogonality-free methods for the discretized problem, and the generation of quality initial guesses to reduce divergence issues related to nonlinearity.
