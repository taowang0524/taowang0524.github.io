I am currently working as an associate professor in School of Mathematics and Statistics of Guangdong University of Techonology. My focus is on numerical methods for the Kohn–Sham equation and complex Langevin methods in quantum chromodynamics.

In the area of the Kohn-Sham equation, I am working on several aspects, including the design adaptive methods and high order methods for discretization, the development of orthogonality-free methods for the discretized problem, and the generation of quality initial guesses to reduce divergence issues related to nonlinearity.
