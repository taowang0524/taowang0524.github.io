I am currently a PhD candidate in School of Mathematics of Jilin University, majoring in computational mathematicals. My focus is on the isogeometric analysis and its applications on the Kohn-â€“Sham density functional theory.

In this field, I am working on several aspects, including the design adaptive methods and high-order methods for discretization and the numerical performance of isogeometric analysis for Kohn--Sham equation.
